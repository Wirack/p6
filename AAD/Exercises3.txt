Suppose that we want to compute a table of distances between each pair of cities in a large map with V cities. Also, we know that each city has at most square root of V roads going from or to the city. Which algorithm (repeated Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall) would be the most efficient, asymptotically, for the task?
Floyd = Theta(V³)
repeated Dijkstra's = O(V²*log(V)+V^2.5) => O(V^2.5)

Suppose that D is a matrix whose ij-th entry is the length of a shortest path from i to j in an undirected, weighted graph G with n vertices. Write an O(n^2) algorithm that updates D when an additional edge is inserted into G.
