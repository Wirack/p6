\section{Usability Test}\label{sec:usability-test}
To ensure that the customers are able to use the application to create pictograms, a usability test is performed.
Furthermore, the usability test is performed to ensure that the application is easy to learn.
The reason why the application have to be easy to learn is that the customers are not used to operate with an android tablet and they are not using computers that often.
Moreover, the customers are getting a tablet with the application installed and are therefore not told how to use the application beforehand.

To make a usability test several tasks, which makes the testers try all parts of the program, are being constructed. 
The testers then have to try to complete these tasks without help from any other.
If they are unable to complete the tasks without help, they can ask the person that are with them in the room.
Problems are then described and put into categories depending on how they are complete the tasks.
The problems are categorised into three categories which are cosmetic, serious, and critical.
Problems that are categorised as cosmetic are something that are slowing the testers down by a few seconds.
When a problem is categorised as serious is when the testers are unable to solve the problem without any help or are stuck for several seconds.
The worst type of problem is critical, this problem occurs when the testers are unable to solve the problem and the person sitting next to the testers are having to show them how to perform the task.

\subsection*{P1 - Change Camera Picture to Black and White}
This problem occurred when the test had to take a picture of their chair in black and white.
The problem was that one of the testers just took the picture and though that they could change the colour of the picture afterwards.
Another tester would to fast and did not read the tasks good enough and therefore forgot to pick black and white.

The reason why this is a cosmetic problem is that the first tester had some problems find out how to change the colour of the picture.
However, the second tester found the color changer right when the tester was told that it should be in black and white.

\subsection*{P2 - Clear Canvas}
When the testers had to clear the canvas, after drawing, they had problems finding the button to clear the canvas.
However, after looking around for few seconds the testers were able to locate the button, which is why the problem is only cosmetic.
