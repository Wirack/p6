\subsection{Resizing camera pictures}
A request from the customer was that the pictures from the camera should scale instead of resizing its dimensions independently such that the picture would retain its quality.
To constrain the resizing of pictures we found the ratio between its dimensions and multiplied the drag vector with this ratio.

The ratio was found by dividing the width with height, as the height of the pictures from the camera is always smaller than the width.
The new dimension are then found by finding the length from the top-left corner of the picture to the where the user clicks.
The width of this vector is simply assigned to the width of the picture, and the height is assigned to the width of the vector multiplied with the ratio.
