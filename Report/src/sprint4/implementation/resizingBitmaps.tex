\subsection{Resizing camera pictures}
A request from the customer was that the pictures from the camera should scale instead of resizing its dimensions independently such that the picture would retain its quality.
To constrain the resizing of pictures we find the ratio between its width and height and multiply the drag vector by this ratio.

The ratio is found by dividing the width with the height, when the height of the pictures from the camera is smaller than the width, otherwise it is vice versa.
The new dimension is then found by finding the length from the top-left corner of the picture to where the user clicks.
The x-component of the drag vector is assigned to the width of the picture, and the height is assigned to the y-component of the drag vector multiplied by the ratio.
