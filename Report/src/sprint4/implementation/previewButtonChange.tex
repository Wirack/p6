\subsection{Changing Preview Button}
The current preview button always displayed a square with the fill and stroke colour matching the currently selected colours.
This preview of a square could cause confusion regarding what type of drawing tool the user had selected.

To avoid this confusion, we changed the button's display to match the user's selected drawing tool.
When the user selected the freehand or line tool, the button's display would change to a line with the fill colour as its colour.
The rectangle tool is displayed as it did previously, and the oval tool displayed an oval figure with the same colour structure as in the rectangle.
Selection tool is also a tool available for the user, and when chosen, the \textit{previewButton} would display the selection tool icon.

The button also had the feature of swapping colours as mentioned in \secref{sec:colorSwap}, but this feature is unavailable when the freehand, line, and selection tool are chosen, as it is not intuitive to swap to a colour that is not visible.
