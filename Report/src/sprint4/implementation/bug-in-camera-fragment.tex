\subsection*{Bug in the Camera Fragment}
When using the camera to take pictures after the camera has been swapped between back and front camera, a bug was found.
The bug was that the next time the camera fragment was accessed, the camera was not available and had to be solved.
The bug was determined to be that the camera was not released when the camera fragment was closed.
Two surfaces were used in the camera fragment, so the releasing of camera could not only be performed in the \textit{onPause} method, but had to be added to the \textit{surfaceDestroyed} method.
