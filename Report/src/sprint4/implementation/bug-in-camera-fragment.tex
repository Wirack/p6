\subsection*{Bug in the Camera Dialogue}
When using the camera to take pictures after the camera is swapped between back and front camera, a bug is found.
The bug is that the next time the camera dialogue is accessed, the camera is not available.
It is found that the camera is not released when the camera dialogue is closed.
Two surfaces are used in the camera dialogue, so the releasing of camera can not only be performed in the \textit{onPause} method, but has to be added to the \textit{surfaceDestroyed} method.
