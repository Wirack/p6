\subsection{Pictures should fill canvas}
A request was made by the customers that once a picture is taken with the camera it should fill the drawing field.
To do this we look at the width and height of the drawing field and find the relation between the picture and the drawing field, and create a new bitmap where the bitmap is scaled with this relation in a proper aspect ratio.
This scaling makes the picture fit the drawing field in size.
The placement of the picture is determined from the picture's centre, which is assigned to the drawing fields centre.
The code implementation for this can be seen in \lstref{lst:loadPicture}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Method which scales the picture},label=lst:loadPicture]
private void loadPicture(Bitmap bitmap){
	int sizeHeightPercentage = (int)(((double)(this.getBitmap().getHeight())/(double)(bitmap).getHeight())*100.0) + 1;
	int sizeWidthPercentage = (int)(((double)(this.getBitmap().getWidth())/(double)(bitmap).getWidth())*100.0);
	
	BitmapEntity tempEntity = new BitmapEntity(bitmap, Math.max(sizeHeightPercentage, sizeWidthPercentage));
	tempEntity.setCenter(drawFragment.drawView.getMeasuredWidth()/2, drawFragment.drawView.getMeasuredHeight()/2 - 4.0f);
	DrawStackSingleton.getInstance().mySavedData.addEntity(tempEntity);
	drawFragment.drawView.invalidate();
}
\end{lstlisting}
