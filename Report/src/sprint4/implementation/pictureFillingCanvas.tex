\subsection{Pictures should fill whole canvas}
A request was made by the customers that once a picture was taken with the camera it should fill the drawing field.
To do this we looked at the height and width of the drawing field and found the relation between the picture and the drawing field, and created a new bitmap where the bitmap was scaled with this relation.
This scaling made the picture fit the drawing field in size.
The placement of the picture was decided from the picture's centre, which was simply assigned to the drawing fields centre.
