\section{Sprint Backlog}
For sprint 4, the sprint backlog consists of the following.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[Negative width and height during resize]
Allowing negative width and height during resize gives volatile behaviour and should thus be constrained.

\item[Bug in the camera dialogue]
A bug occurs when a picture is taken after the camera has been swapped between front and back camera, and when the camera dialogue is accessed again there is no camera feed.

\item[Change help pictures]
Make new help pictures illustrating tutorials with the new user interface.

\item[Changes to accessibility settings]
Change the settings from private and public to be for citizen specific or available to whole institution.

\item[Pictures should fill whole canvas]
Pictures taken with the camera should fill the canvas.

\item[Resizing camera pictures]
Resizing camera pictures should be limited to scaling, such that the aspect ratio is kept.

\item[Preview button with suitable display]
Make the preview button show the selected tool instead of always a rectangle.
