\subsection{Custom Colour Button}
The colour choices available in the application were unchangeable as they had hard coded values.
Due to this, a need for additional colour choices would arise, if a customer needed a specific colour that was not available.
This functionality is added by using an already created implementation of a colour picker created by the group responsible for graphical components in the \textit{GIRAF} project. 
The colour picker has a full spectrum of colours, once a colour is chosen it can be shaded.
In addition to the colour picker, we create a button to allow for quick reselection of the last colour chosen in the colour picker.
This button is added because we believe that having to go into the colour picker to reselect would be a nuisance.
