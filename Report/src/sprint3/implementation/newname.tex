\subsection{Consider New Name for Title and Name in Save Dialogue}
These two fields needed to have the text changed, as both the customers as well as other people had trouble understanding the difference between information contained in the two fields.
The previous text in Danish, "titel på pictogram" and "pictogram navn", was changed to "tekst på piktogram" and "piktogram navn". 
The reason it is only such a slight change is that the main confusion seemed to be the result of the use of the word "titel", Danish for title, and we think that by replacing it with the word "tekst", Danish for text, the meaning becomes more clear. 
It is not yet known if this is the case, as this change has not yet been checked with the customers, so there is a risk it changes nothing, but will be checked in the next meeting with the customers.
