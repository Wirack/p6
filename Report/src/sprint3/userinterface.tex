\section{User Interface}
A meeting was established with two of the customers, Drazenko and Pernille \citep{misc:drazenko, misc:pernille}.
From the meeting it was found that the general drawing interface seemed suitable, however, after they tried to use the application, some flaws were found.
The flaws were mainly the way to take photos, which was deemed unintuitive, as you had to take multiple pictures and then later choose which one to load into the pictogram.
Furthermore, a new position ordering of the drawing tools was requested.
This was mainly a request from Pernille, as she found that options for the drawing tools should be located near each other.
Additionally, the colour theme of the application was changed such that the graphical components developed by the \textit{GIRAF Components} group was used.

The implemented version can be seen in \appref{app:further-deflopment}
