\section{User Interface}
A meeting was established with two of the customers, Drazenko and Pernille \citep{misc:drazenko, misc:pernille}.
From the meeting it was found that the general drawing interface seemed suitable.
However, after they tried to use the application, some flaws were found.
The flaws were mainly how you take pictures, which is deemed unintuitive, as you have to take multiple pictures and then later choose which one to load into the pictogram.

Furthermore, a new position ordering of the drawing tools was requested.
This was mainly a request from Pernille, as she found that options for the drawing tools should be located near each other.
Additionally, the colour theme of the application is changed such that the graphical components developed by the \textit{gComponents} group is used.

The chosen version can be seen in \appref{}.
This version of the UI is not yet tested, and as of such can not be determined as final yet.
Future sprints have to focus on presenting the UI to the customers and perform usability tests to ensure that a good quality of the application is achieved.
