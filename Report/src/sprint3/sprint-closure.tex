\section{Sprint Closure}
% What did we do?
The issues of sprint 3 have been resolved to some degree, due to usability tests not being performed in sprint 3.
Additionally, the camera dialogue still needs some development, as a bug occur that results in stretching of the dialogue unintentionally.

% Hvad ved vi grundet sprint end meeting
The application was presented to the customers at the sprint end meeting, where general positive feedback was received.
A few requests were proposed, such as the possibility of assigning pictograms to specific citizens instead of the whole institution.
In relation to this, it was found that there is only a need of one guardian profile per institution, which is why the distinction between guardians is not necessary, but is kept as it is resolved in the guardians using a shared profile.
This sharing of a profile is, however, a temporary solution, as the guardians should have their own profile with their private settings.

Furthermore, it was found that resizing of camera pictures should be changed to scaling, such that the aspect ratio is kept.

For the next sprint, these issues are focused on, in addition to usability and regular tests, to ensure a good application quality.
