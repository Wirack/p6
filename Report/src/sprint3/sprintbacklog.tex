\item[Camera Fragment]
The way import pictures worked through the camera was deemed unlogical by the customers, they desired something more akin to Instagram that did not require them to go into another fragment, but rather open sort of a dialogue box instead.

\item[GUI - rearrange canvas]
Rearrange all buttons in accordance with customer expectation.

\item[Load drawstack]
Change load functionality to load drawstack if the pictogram is saved by PictoCreator.
This is only possible after the database has been updated to accommodate this change.

\item[Text on buttons]
There have to be text below the icon of every button.

\item[Radio button for "public" save dialogue]
Make two radio buttons for the save dialogue.
The first should be for the private setting and the other for the public setting.

Need a button to pick a custom colour.
