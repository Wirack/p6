\section{Sprint Backlog}
The sprint backlog for the third sprint is as follows.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[New text for title and name in save dialogue]
The name of the title and name in the save dialogue have to be changed so it is more understandable for the customers.

\item[Resize rotated entities]
Have an intuitive resizing of entities after they have been rotated.

\item[Camera dialogue]
The way import pictures worked through the camera is deemed illogical by the customers. 
They desired something more akin to \textit{Instagram} \citep{misc:instagram} that does not require them to go into another dialogue, but rather open a dialogue box instead.

\item[GUI changes]
Rearrange all buttons in accordance with customer expectation.

\item[Load drawstack]
Change load functionality to load drawstack if the pictogram is created in \textit{Piktotegner}.
This is only possible after the database has been updated to accommodate this change.

\item[Text on buttons]
There has to be text below the icon of every button as requested by the customers.

\item[Radio button for "public" save dialogue]
Make two radio buttons for the save dialogue.
The first should be for the private setting and the other for the public setting.

\item[Custom Colour button]
Need a button to choose a custom colour.
