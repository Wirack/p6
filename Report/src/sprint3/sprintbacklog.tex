\item[Consider new name for title and name in save dialogue]
The name of the title and name in the save dialogue have to be changed so it is more understandable for the customer.

\item[Resize rotated obejcts]
Be able to rotate an object and resize it afterwards.

\item[Resize]
Resize on rotated objects is handled poorly, needs a fix.

\item[Hitbox on rotated objects during resize]
During resize of a rotated objects, the hitbox moves too much, needs to be stabilized.

\item[Camera Fragment]
The way import pictures worked through the camera was deemed unlogical by the custommers, they desired something more akin to instagram that did not require them to go into another fragment, but rather open sort of a dialog box instead.

\item[GUI - rearrange canvas]
Rearange all buttons in acordance with custommer expectation.

\item[Load drawstack]
Change load code to load drawstack if such is provided (happens when loaded picture is created in pictocreator)
This is only possible after the database has been updated to acomodate this change.

\item[Text on buttons]
There have to be text below the icon of every button.

\item[Radio button for "public" save dialogue]
Make two radio buttons for the save dialogue.
The first should be private and the other should be public.

\item[Custom Colour button]
Need a button to pick a custom colour.

\item[Stroke width bar change to GSeekbar]
