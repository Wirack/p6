\subsection{Features}
A lot of features of \textit{Croc} are tied to the user interface, and for that reason it makes sense to present the \textit{Croc} UI.
%canvas features
In order to get an idea of how the \textit{Croc} UI looks like, see \figref{fig:croc-old-canvas}. 

The UI is divided into two parts, the upper serving as a menu-bar allowing access to the camera, audio recorder, help view, closing the application, or saving the pictogram.
The lower part changes depending on the mode chosen.
In the figure, the lower part shows the UI for the following features.

\begin{itemize}
     \item Selection tool
     \item Freehand, rectangle, line, and ellipsis drawing tool
     \item Choosing a colour
     \item Importing camera picture
     \item Preview of chosen colours
     \item Changing stroke width
\end{itemize}

Other features exists for the camera and audio recording, which include switching between black/white and colour pictures, take picture, and start/end recording.
For an illustration of the camera and audio recorder, see \appref{app:crocUI}.
