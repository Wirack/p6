\subsection{Colour Swap}
To resolve this issue, the class diagram was used to identify a connection between the preview button and the draw view.
Two connections are found between \textit{DravView} and \textit{PreviewButton}, which is \textit{ColorButton} and \textit{DrawFragment}.
\textit{ColorButton} is used when picking a new colour, and assigns the new colour to \textit{PreviewButton}.
However, when pressing the \textit{PreviewButton}, no connection existed.
In order to correct this issue, the event for touching \textit{PreviewButton} could be accessed from \textit{DrawFragment} and was already implemented for the other buttons. \fxnote{Overvej om denne del skal skæres fra, eller om den giver værdi i form af vores analyse af problemet.}

In order to correct this issue, the \textit{onTouch} event was moved from \textit{PreviewButton} to \textit{DrawFragment}, since \textit{DrawFragment} had access to both \textit{DrawView} and \textit{PreviewButton}.
\textit{DrawFragment} was already subscribed to the other buttons, thus it was a logical change to move the touch event of \textit{PreviewButton} to \textit{DrawFragment}.
The event implemented in \textit{DrawFragment} can be seen in \lstref{lst:event-previewbuttonclick}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={onPreviewButtonClick event},label=lst:event-previewbuttonclick]
private final OnClickListener onPreviewButtonClick = new OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
       previewButton.swapColors();
       drawView.setFillColor(previewButton.getFillColor());
       drawView.setStrokeColor(previewButton.getStrokeColor());
    }
};
\end{lstlisting}
