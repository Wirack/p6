\subsection{Clear Button}
Before adding the clear button, to clear the canvas you had to either clear each entity individually or to restart the program. 
As this was highly undesired, we decided a clear button was necessary.
The button can be seen in \figref{fig:clear-button}. 
It is decided that the icon of a trash bin is the most fitting, as it is our understanding that most people associate the trash can ion with throwing something away.

\begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{clear-button}
     \caption{Clear button.}
     \label{fig:clear-button}
\end{figure}

In order to clear the canvas it is a matter of clearing the \textit{drawStack}, deselecting selected entities and redrawing the canvas through the \textit{Invalidate()} method, which is performed when the clearing action is accepted.

An unintentional click of the clear button would be of great nuisance to ones work. 
Thus, a dialogue box is added, requesting final confirmation for the clear operation.
