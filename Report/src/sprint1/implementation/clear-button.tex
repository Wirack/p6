\subsection{Clear Button}
Before adding the clear button, to clear the canvas you had to either clear each entity individually or to restart the program. 
As this was highly undesired, we decided a clear button was necessary.
It is decided that the icon of a trash bin is the most fitting, as it is our understanding that most people associate the trash can icon with throwing something away.

In order to clear the canvas it is a matter of clearing the \textit{drawStack}, deselecting selected entities and redrawing the canvas through the \textit{Invalidate()} method, which is performed when the clearing action is accepted.

An unintentional click of the clear button would be of great nuisance to ones work. 
Thus, a dialogue box is added, requesting final confirmation for the clear operation.
