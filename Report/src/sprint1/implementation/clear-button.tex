\subsection{Clear Button}
Before adding the clear button, to clear the canvas you had to either delete each entity individually or to restart the application. 
As this was highly undesired, we decide a clear button is necessary.
It is decided that the icon of a trash bin is the most fitting as it is our understanding that most people associate the trash bin icon with throwing something away.

In order to clear the canvas it is a matter of clearing the \textit{drawStack}, deselecting the selected entity, and redrawing the canvas through the \textit{Invalidate()} method, which is performed when the clearing action is accepted. 
\textit{drawStack} is an \textit{ArrayList} consisting of entities, which conceptually functions as a stack, with entities drawn on top of each other.

An unintentional click of the clear button would be of great nuisance to ones work. 
Thus, a dialogue box is added, requesting final confirmation for the clear operation.
