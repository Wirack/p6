\subsection{Loading Pictures From Camera in Correct Size}
In order to fix this issue, as described in \secref{}\fxwarning{Mangler en ref}, it was necessary to look at the function that loads the pictures into canvas.
Previously the function took the picture as it was and loaded it into canvas.
Therefore it was imported in a too large scale, which could not fit into canvas.
The issue was fixed by implementing a new constructor when creating a picture.
The new constructor was similar to the old constructor but with the option of including a scale factor as input.
The old constructor can be seen in \lstref{BitmapEnity-Constructor-Old}, and the new in \lstref{BitmapEnity-Constructor-New}, which is used to change the width and height by a percentage corresponding to the size value.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Old Constructor}, label=lst:BitmapEnity-Constructor-Old, float=h]
public BitmapEntity(Bitmap src) {
  internalBitmap = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(src);
  
  setHeight(internalBitmap.getHeight());
  setWidth(internalBitmap.getWidth());
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={New Constructor}, label=lst:BitmapEnity-Constructor-New, float=h]
public BitmapEntity(Bitmap src, int size) {
  internalBitmap = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(src, 
      src.getWidth() * size / 100, 
      src.getHeight() * size / 100, true);
  
  setHeight(internalBitmap.getHeight());
  setWidth(internalBitmap.getWidth());
}
\end{lstlisting}
