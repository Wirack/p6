\subsection{Scale Camera Pictures}
When a picture in the canvas is selected, it shows the resize button, and when the resize functionality is accessed, it resizes the hitbox, but it does not change the size of the picture. 
In order to make this resizing possible, a new method is created. 
This method takes a width and length as input, and recreates the picture based on this information.
