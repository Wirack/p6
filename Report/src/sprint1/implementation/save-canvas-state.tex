\subsection{Save Canvas State}\fxnote{SÃ¥ kort at den er optional}
To fix the issue, the \textit{drawStack} was saved as a singleton, which made a single \textit{drawStack} instance available across modes, such that even when the canvas was restarted, the \textit{drawStack} could be reloaded. 
The canvas will still be cleared if the process is terminated, however, for the given issue the singleton will suffice.
