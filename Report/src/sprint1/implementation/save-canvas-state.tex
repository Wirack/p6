\subsection{Save Canvas State}
To fix the issue, the \textit{drawStack} is saved as a singleton, which makes a single \textit{drawStack} instance available across modes, such that even when the canvas is restarted, the \textit{drawStack} can be reloaded. 
The canvas is still be cleared if the process is terminated, however, for the given issue the singleton will suffice.
