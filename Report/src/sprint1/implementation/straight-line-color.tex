\subsection{Straight Line Colour}
The straight line colour was changed to be that of the fill colour instead of the stroke colour.
The problem was that when picking a colour and then drawing a line, the colour of the line would be that of the stroke colour, instead of the picked colour.
This was deemed non intuitive, and thus the colour used to draw the line was change to the fill colour.
The issue was fixed by changing a method call to take the fill colour instead of the stroke colour.
