\subsection{Straight Line Colour}
The straight line colour is changed to be that of the fill colour instead of the stroke colour.
The problem was that when picking a colour and then drawing a line, the colour of the line would be that of the stroke colour, instead of the picked colour.
This is deemed non-intuitive, and thus the colour used to draw the line is changed to the fill colour.
The issue is resolved by changing a method call to take the fill colour instead of the stroke colour.
