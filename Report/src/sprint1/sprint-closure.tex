\section{Sprint Closure}
To conclude, the sprint has been successful, as the issues for the sprint have been resolved, but an additional issue is found. 
The stroke width of an entity was not taken into account when determining collision detection, resulting in squashed boxes with a large stroke not being selectable, and should be resolved in the next sprint. 
In addition to this, the application also shows a tendency to crash when a large amount of entities are drawn, as it runs out of memory to store the entities. 
Furthermore, issues from the product backlog which is not in the sprint backlog should be considered for future sprints.
Another thing to note, is that the UI changes that are made require usability tests in order to verify that the assumptions made regarding what is intuitive, actually correspond to the users' understanding.
