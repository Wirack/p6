\section{Sprint Closure}
To conclude, the sprint has been successful, as the issues for the sprint have been resolved. 
An additional issue was found. The stroke width of an entity was not taken into account when determining collision detection, resulting in squashed boxes with a large stroke not being selectable, and should be fixed for the next sprint. In addition to this, the application also shows a tendency to crash when a large amount of objects are drawn, as the heap runs out of space to store the objects. 
Furthermore, issues from the product backlog which was not in the sprint backlog should be considered for future sprints.
Another thing to note, is that the UI changes that was made require usability tests in order to verify that the assumptions made regarding what is intuitive, actually correspond to the users' understanding.
