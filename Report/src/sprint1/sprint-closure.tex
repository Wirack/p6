\section{Sprint Closure}
To conclude, the sprint has been successful, as the issues for the sprint have been resolved. 
An additional issue was found. The stroke width of an entity was not taken into account when determining collision detection, resulting in squashed boxes with a large stroke not being selectable, and should be fixed for the next sprint.
Furthermore, issues from the product backlog which was not in the sprint backlog should be considered for future sprints.
