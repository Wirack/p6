%hvad croc er
Croc is a part of the GIRAF software package. 
It is meant to support manual creation of pictograms.
In that regard, to create a pictogram, the user can take pictures, record audio, and draw their own pictures.
These options can then be used in any combination as the user sees fit for a given pictogram.

%hvem bruger det
The target audience are guardians and parents, contrary to other parts of GIRAF. 
For that reason, the design focus is on usability for guardians as well as to make suitable pictograms, rather than educational or entertainment purposes.

%Crocs kontekst - database
Croc is developed as an application that may be launched from other applications in the GIRAF project.
When a pictogram has been created in Croc it is meant to be stored in a database to make it accessible from other applications.
