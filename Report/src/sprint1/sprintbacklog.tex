\section{Sprint Backlog}
As mentioned before, in this sprint we add missing features and resolve bugs in the application we are assigned to.
Some of these issues are found by the group working on the application last year, and the rest have been found by testing the functionality of the application.
The different issues found are prioritised and estimated through planning poker.
By this estimation and prioritisation, the following sprint backlog is constructed:

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[Change stroke width]
	Be able to change the stroke width for freehand drawing.
	\item[Loading pictures from camera in suitable size]
	Pictures loaded into the canvas are zoomed in too much, as the picture is larger than the canvas.
	\item[Colour swap]
	The colour swap button does nothing at the moment. The fill and stroke colour should be able to be swapped by a click on the colour swap button.
	\item[Straight line colour]
	Straight lines can only be drawn in black, it should be able to be drawn with the selected colour.
	\item[Icon changes]
     In general several icons do not represent their functionality, therefore they need to be changed.
	\item[Clear button]
	Implement a button in canvas to clear the canvas.
	\item[Collision detection for rotated entities]
	The collision detection only works when entities are not rotated. It needs to be changed to also work for rotated entities.
	\item[Save canvas state]
	Find a way to save the drawStack between uses. That is when switching to camera and back, or between app uses.
	\item[Record dialogue]
	Change dialogue box for recording, as the visuals does not match the expectations of how a sound recorder works.
	\item[Scale camera pictures]
	Pictures taken with the camera should be scalable in canvas.
