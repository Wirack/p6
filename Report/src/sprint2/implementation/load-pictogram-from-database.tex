\subsection{Load Pictogram from Database}
The application should be able to load existing pictograms, so they can be modified to accommodate desired changes.
To do this we decided to use \textit{Pictosearch}, which is an application that is also under development in the \textit{GIRAF} project.
\textit{Pictosearch} is a search tool that can find pictograms stored in the database.
The chosen pictogram is then sent to calling application, which in this case is \textit{Pictocreator}.

The call to start \textit{Pictosearch} also sends the guardian's ID, to allow access to their private pictograms, as well as the purpose of the call which is \textit{single} meaning \textit{Pictosearch} can return at most one pictogram, as seen in lines $5-9$ in \lstref{lst:callPictosearch}.
If \textit{Pictosearch} is not installed, a message will inform the user about it.
An event to receive the pictogram is create, called \textit{onActivityResult}, and checks whether it return a results or not.
If there is a result, another function is called which loads the pictogram bitmap from the database using the pictogram ID returned from \textit{Pictosearch}, as seen in line 5 in  \lstref{lst:loadPictogram}.
The bitmap is then loaded into the canvas in the original scale.

        intent.putExtra("currentGuardianID", author);
        intent.putExtra("purpose", "single");

        startActivityForResult(intent, RESULT_FIRST_USER);
    } catch (Exception e){
        Toast.makeText( this, "Pictosearch er ikke installeret.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

        int pictogramID = data.getExtras().getIntArray("checkoutIds")[0];

        Bitmap pictogram = (PictoFactory.getPictogram(this, pictogramID).getImageData());

        drawFragment.drawView.loadFromBitmap(pictogram);
    }catch(Exception e){
        Log.e(TAG, e + ": No pictogram returned.");
    }
