\subsection{Preview Pictogram}
Previously when loading the preview, it was handled in the draw view and was saved on the cache.
This proved to be a problem, as it was unclear how the timing of saving to the cache worked, and using that storage was vulnerable to sudden cache clearings.
In order to fix this issue, the Bitmap encoding of the pictogram was parsed to the save dialogue instead, which made the preview unaffected by sudden cache clearings.
