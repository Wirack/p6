\subsection{Preview Pictogram}
Previously when loading the preview, it was handled in the \textit{drawView} and was saved on the cache.
This proved to be a problem, as it was unclear how the timing of saving to the cache worked, and using that storage was vulnerable to sudden cache clearings.
In order to solve this issue, the Bitmap encoding of the pictogram is parsed to the save dialogue instead, which makes the preview unaffected by sudden cache clearings.
