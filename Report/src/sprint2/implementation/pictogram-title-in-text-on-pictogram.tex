\subsection{Pictogram Title in Text on Pictogram}
When talking with the customers, a need for adding text to pictograms was proposed. 
Different options for adding text was discussed, which included adding text to the pictograms themselves or in the dialogue in which the pictogram was saved.
The customers agreed that adding text in the save dialogue made the most sense, and thus text on the pictogram itself was discarded in the first product version to be used by the customers.

The customers wanted the title of the pictograms to be in changeable positions. 
This issue was deemed as not being the responsibility of Pictocreator, as the text is merely stored together with the pictogram and can be placed wherever users of the pictogram wants it.
