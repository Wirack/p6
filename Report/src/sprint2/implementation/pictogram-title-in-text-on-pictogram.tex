\subsection{Pictogram Title in Text on Pictogram}
When talking with the customers, a need for adding text to pictograms was proposed. 
Different options for adding text was discussed, which included adding text to the pictograms themselves or in the dialogue in which the pictogram was saved.
The customers agreed that adding text in the save dialogue made the most sense, and thus text on the pictogram itself was discarded in the first product version to be used by the customers.

For the positioning of the text itself, where the text could be placed on the top or the bottom of the pictogram. It was deemed as no problem from the PictoCreator point of view. 
As the text is merely stored as such together with the pictogram and can be placed wherever users of the pictogram wants it.
