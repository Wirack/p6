\subsection{Load Existing Audio File to the Record Fragment}
Reloading an existing audio file to play after having saved the recording, closed the audio dialogue and played again was found reasonable to implement.
A pictogram can have associated a single sound file.
As of such it was reasonable to make the saved sound file path static.

As the sound file path was made static, it only needed to get assigned a path the first time the record dialogue is added. 
Else you replace that file each time you save a new recording.

One issue occured, which was associated with a play button press before no recording was performed.
This was fixed by deactivating the button when no final file exists, and can be seen in \lstref{lst:playbuttonpress}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:playbuttonpress},caption = {Activating or Deactivating playButton}]
playButton.setEnabled((new File(handler.getFinalPath()).exists()));
\end{lstlisting}
