\subsection{Load Existing Audio File to the Record Fragment}
A pictogram can have a single sound file associated.
As of such it is reasonable to make the saved sound file path static.

As the sound file path is made static, it only needs to get assigned a path the first time the record dialogue is added. 
Else you replace that file each time you save a new recording.

One issue occurred, which is associated with a play button press before no recording is performed.
This issue is fixed by checking if a recording already exists at the static path. If a recording exists at the path the recording is played, if not, a toast is made telling the users that there is no recording.
