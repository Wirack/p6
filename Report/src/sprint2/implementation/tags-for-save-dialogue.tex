\subsection{Tags For Save Dialogue}
Tags were partially added in the GUI but you could not add tags and they could not be stored in the database.
The tags were stored in an ArrayList and displayed in a ListView, such that when modifying the Arraylist the GUI is updated as well.
Implementing the tags gave the opportunity of specifying keywords for the created pictogram, which could be searched for to find the pictogram later.
Assigning the tags to a pictogram was done with use of a database helper provided in the developed Oasis database library.
