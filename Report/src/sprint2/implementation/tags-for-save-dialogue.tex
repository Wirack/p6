\subsection{Tags for Save Dialogue}
Tags were partially added in the GUI but you could not add tags and they could not be stored in the database.
To resolve this, tags are stored in an \textit{ArrayList} and displayed in a \textit{ListView}, such that when modifying the \textit{Arraylist} the GUI is updated as well.
Implementing the tags gives the opportunity of specifying keywords for the created pictogram, which can be searched for to find the pictogram later.
Assigning the tags to a pictogram is done with use of a database helper provided in the developed \textit{Oasis} database library.
