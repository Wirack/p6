\subsection{Flatten Button}
The flatten button functionality was implemented as seen in \lstref{lst:flatten}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:flatten}, caption={Flatten Button functionality}]
public void moveToBack(Entity entity){
   int index = entities.indexOf(entity);
   entities.remove(index);
   entities.add(entities.size(), entity);
}
\end{lstlisting}

As the entities were already stored in a list, it was a matter of moving the entity to the end of the list.
With the flatten button functionality implemented, the order in which a user draws entities can be disregarded, as the order can be changed.
