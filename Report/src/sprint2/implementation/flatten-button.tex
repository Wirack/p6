\subsection{Flatten Button}
The flatten button functionality was implemented as seen in \lstref{lst:flatten}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:flatten}, caption={Flatten Button functionality}]
public void moveToBack(Entity entity){
   int index = entities.indexOf(entity);
   entities.remove(index);
   entities.add(entities.size(), entity);
}
\end{lstlisting}

As the entities was already stored in a List, it was a matter of moving the entity to the end of the list.
With the flatten button functionality implemented, the order in which one draws entities can be disregarded, as the order can be changed.
