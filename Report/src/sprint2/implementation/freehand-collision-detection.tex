\subsection{Freehand Collision Detection}
This issue is resolved by using the collision detection method used for a line.
A collision with the freehand entity should occur when the clicked point is close to the drawn part of the freehand entity.
To do this, each of the line segments have to be compared with the clicked point using the method for line collision detection which is presented in \secref{sec:rotatedlines}.
However, the freehand entity only contains points, so these points are used to create the line segments.
