\subsection{Freehand Collision Detection}
This issue was resolved by using the collision detection used for a line.
However, the freehand drawing only contains points, so these points had to be combined into a line.
All of these lines had to be compared to the collision detection from the line collision, see \secref{sec:rotatedlines}.
