\subsection{Update to \textit{gComponent}}
This issue is a general issue for all the applications in the multi project. 
A group was assigned to create a GUI framework to the multi project such that the GUI has the same look in all applications.

To implement this framework, we have to add the path for the \textit{gComponent} such that they can be used in the XML-files that define the GUI.
Each existing button is changed to a matching \textit{gComponent} and its functionality changed to work with the new framework.
This implementation resulted in deletion of several XML-files that were used to create the previous buttons and their functionality is now taken care of by the framework.

The clear dialogue changed more drastically than the rest of the interface, as the framework also contains a method to create simple confirmation dialogue. 
This change results in removal of the clear dialogue XML-file, as it is no longer needed.
