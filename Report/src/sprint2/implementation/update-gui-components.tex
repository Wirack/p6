\subsection{Update GUI Components}
This issue was a general issue for all the applications in the project. 
A group was assigned to create a GUI framework to the project so that the GUI had the same look in all applications.

To implement this framework, we had to add the path for the GUI-components such that they could be used in our XML-files that define our GUI.
Each existing button was change to a matching gComponent and its functionality changed to work with the new framework.
This implementation resulted in deletion of several XML-files that were used to create the previous buttons, their functionality now taken care of by the framework.

The clear dialogue changed more drastically than the rest of the interface, as the framework also contains a method to create simple confirmation windows. This change resulted in removal of the clear dialogue XML-file, as it was no longer needed.
