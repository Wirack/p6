\subsection{Colour Settings from Launcher Use in PictoCreator}
The colour settings originally parsed from the Launcher application can be applied to the layout with a gradient effect by use of the HSV colour encoding.
Later, the Launcher group decided that this colour schema from the Launcher should not be applied after all, but the following description serves as a documentation of how it was implemented.

We make a gradient colour with use of the HSV encoding format with adjustment of the value parameter, to give a better depth to the background layout.
If the application is not opened from Launcher, or the Launcher does not parse a colour value, a default colour scheme is applied.
