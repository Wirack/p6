\subsection{Use Colour Settings from \textit{Launcher} in \textit{Pictocreator}}
The colour settings originally parsed from the \textit{Launcher} application can be applied to the layout with a gradient effect by use of the HSV colour encoding.
Later, the \textit{Launcher} group decided that this colour schema from the \textit{Launcher} should not be applied after all, but the following description serves as a documentation of how it was implemented.

We make a gradient colour with use of the HSV encoding format with adjustment of the value parameter, to give a better depth to the background layout.
If the application is not opened from \textit{Launcher}, or the \textit{Launcher} does not parse a colour value, a default colour scheme is applied.
