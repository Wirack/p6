\section{Sprint Closure}
The issues for the sprint have been resolved.
In addition, contact was established with the customers, where they expressed an opinion on the current UI, which they wanted to have changed.
This opens for a new issue for following sprints to change the UI of the application.
Additionally, the customers expressed the requirement of loading old pictograms for editing, where the pictograms should not be overwritten, but save an extra modified version instead.
Another application, \textit{Pictosearch}, worked on by another group, is needed to search for pictograms.
However, \textit{Pictosearch} at its current state crashes at startup, and needs to be resolved before further work regarding loading of pictograms can be pursued.
The application still crashes, but seems to have been reduced to memory issues where the heap runs out of space.
It is believed that this can be minimise by reducing the amount of camera images stored in the cache to the ones taken for a specific pictogram.
Furthermore, tests are believed to be crucial in future sprints to minimise bugs before a final release is published to the customers.\fxnote{samme spørgsmål som i sprint 1, skal current product backlog listes}
