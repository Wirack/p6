\chapter{Reflections}
Working in a multi project setting has been a great learning experience.
Starting the multi project, a deal of confusion existed as to how the project should be structured, as the project guidelines have been very different from previous semesters.

That being said, after the first couple of weeks getting used to the setting, the development was fun, however, it requires that you are willing to cooperate with other groups, and is necessary to get the whole software package to be consistent.
Furthermore, it helped loosen up the project groups and provided a more social environment than previous semesters.

When questions arose, it was a matter of knocking on the door of the other group's group room, and the issue would be quickly resolved.
In addition to this, SCRUM was utilised to manage the software development.
It was done in a SCRUM of SCRUMs where a status meeting was held each week.
We found this as a good technique, as when groups had problems, they could be found before too many resources were spent.

The product and sprint backlogs of most of the applications were organised in the tool called Redmine, and we found this a useful tool.
This was useful because it made you able to monitor your own project as well as the whole multi project, to see if you are on track.
In addition to this, it was a way to give a concise description of each issue and ensure that no issues were forgotten.

Git was also a useful tool, as it helped ensure version control, and is recommended for future students.
In addition to this, because we work in a big multi project, it is mandatory to have a tool such as GIT.
The reason for this is that we depend on libraries developed by other applications, such as the database library and pictogram library.
You do not have to adapt to changes in their developed libraries immediately, where you could risk getting interrupted all the time, to adapt to the changes made in those libraries. 
Instead you can wait to update your submodules for a fitting time in your schedule.
However, it takes some time getting used to Git, in addition, submodules were good but some git structure was problematic.
This occurred if we were dependent on a submodule which is then dependent on another submodule that we are also dependent on.
The submodule would then use our submodule which may have another revision and would have to be adjusted thereto.
For future students, it is recommended to use a development branch if you are making some unstable changes to your code.
Furthermore, before pushing you should ensure that your code is compilable.

In relation to this comes the automatic build service Jenkins. 
It was set to automatically build the different changes when new revisions were added to Git. 
People who may have pushed non-compilable code would then be notified, such that they could correct their mistakes.
As good tool as Jenkins was, it got in use late in the development cycle, and if we were to do the multi project development again, we would recommend getting Jenkins in use as early as possible.

In order to also ensure that we had a role in the multi project, we had a person responsible for making icons for all the applications in the multi setting.
This ensured that we also provided a role other than developing the Piktotegner application, in order to feel that we provided more to the whole project. 
Future students are also recommended to engage in such activities, being it icon creation, Git, Jenkins, or Redmine responsibility.

Customer communication was a positive experience, although it was difficult to establish contact.
This is found to primarily be due to not contacting the customers in timely manner.
As the other responsibility roles, we also had a person responsible for establishing contact with the customers.
We found that usability tests was performed too late, as it was done in the two final days of sprint 4, thus the experiences from the usability tests could not be implemented in the application.
In the future, it would be wise to perform the usability tests earlier, in order to correct on the issues found during the tests.

To summarize, the multi project was a great learning experience and is recommended to try for any student, as you get to work in a very different setting than what you are used to in previous semesters.
