\section{PictoMediaPlayer}
\label{sec:pictomediaplayer}
Associating sound to pictograms was stated as of great importance from the customers.
For that reason a library is developed that provides an easy to use sound playing service.

Both \textit{Piktotegner} and \textit{Piktooplæser} need the sound playing feature. 

\textit{Piktotegner} needs it to get a preview of the sound recorded, to be saved when creating a pictogram.

\textit{Piktooplæser} needs the feature as the key feature of \textit{Piktooplæser} is to get the sound of the pictograms played sequentially. 

The cooperation for developing the library was done by way of pair programming, with one person from each group.
As of such, a mutual agreement was found for how the library should be developed.

When initializing the library it needs a context and can additionally take a path for the sound file, a pictogram, or a bytearray. The context is needed for the PictoMediaPlayer to know where to play the sound. Below in \lstref{lst:constructor} we see a constructor for the PictoMediaPlayer.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Constructor for PictoMediaPlayer.},label={lst:constructor}]
public PictoMediaPlayer (Context activity, String path)
{
    this.activity = activity;
    assignMediaPlayer();
    setDataSource(path);
}
\end{lstlisting}

When assigning a datasource to the PictoMediaPlayer the \textit{setDataSource} method, seen in \lstref{lst:setdatasource}, is called. The method releases an old MediaPlayer and assigns a new one if sound has already been attached to the MediaPlayer.
Then the MediaPlayer gets a file descriptor assigned as source.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={SetDataSource method of PictoMediaPlayer.},label={lst:setdatasource}]
public void setDataSource(String path)
{
    if(hasSound)
    {
        mediaPlayer.release();
        assignMediaPlayer();
    }

    try
    {
        FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(path);

        mediaPlayer.setDataSource(fileInputStream.getFD());
        hasSound = true;
    }
    catch (IOException e)
    {
        e.getStackTrace();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \textit{OnCompletionListener}, seen in \lstref{lst:completelistener}, is necessary for external sources to detect when a sound is finished playing. The listener allows external sources to respond to a sound finished playing, e.g. a button icon change.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={onCompletionListener method of PictoMediaPlayer.}, label={lst:completelistener}]
private final MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener onCompletionListener = new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener()
{
    @Override
    public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) 
    {
        isPlaying = false;
        if(customListener != null)
        {
            customListener.soundDonePlaying();
        }
    }
};

public interface CompleteListener
{
    public void soundDonePlaying();
}
\end{lstlisting}

For \textit{Piktooplæser} to play the sound of multiple pictograms in succession we made the \textit{playListOfPictograms} method as seen in \lstref{lst:playlist}. 
We first store the old listener in a temporary variable and stop playing sounds. Then we overwrite the method which is run after a sound is complete, so that it plays the sound of the next pictogram in the list. When all pictograms in the list have been read the listener is reset. %Kan måske skrives bedre.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={playListOfPictograms method of PictoMediaPlayer.}, label={lst:playlist}]
public void playListOfPictograms(ArrayList<Pictogram> pictogramList)
{
    pictogramListIndex = 0;
    this.pictogramList = pictogramList;
    TempCompleteListener = customListener;

    if(isPlaying)
    {
        stopSound();
    }
    this.setCustomListener(this);
    this.setDataSource(pictogramList.get(pictogramListIndex));
    this.playSound();
}

@Override
public void soundDonePlaying()
{
    pictogramListIndex ++;
    if (pictogramListIndex < pictogramList.size() && pictogramList.get(pictogramListIndex) != null)
    {
        setDataSource(pictogramList.get(pictogramListIndex));
        playSound();
    }
    else
    {
        this.setCustomListener(TempCompleteListener);
        pictogramListIndex = 0;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

To illustrate the ease of use of the PictoMediaPlayer we created the example seen in \lstref{lst:mediaplayerexample}. 
We here see how a PictoMediaPlayer is used to play a sound and writing ``Sound is finished playing'' when the sound is finished playing.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of PictoMediaPlayer.},label={lst:mediaplayerexample}]
public class example implements CompleteListener
{
    private void examplemethod(Context context, String path)
    {
        PictoMediaPlayer pictoMediaPlayer = new PictoMediaPlayer(context, path);

	pictoMediaPlayer.setCustomListener(this);
        pictoMediaPlayer.playSound();
    }

    @Override
    public void soundDonePlaying()
    {
        System.out.print("Sound is finished playing");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

%Disposition
%interest in the feature from both groups

% why?
% easy use
% just specify a filepath and all features are there. 



% List of features:
    % abstracts away of the states of android's MediaPlayer
    % Play and stop music
    % supports customer listerner for listening to when sound is done playing.
