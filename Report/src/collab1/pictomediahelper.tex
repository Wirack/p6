\section{PictoMediaPlayer}
Associating sound to pictograms was stated as of great importance from the customers.
For that reason a library is developed that provides an easy to use sound playing service.

Both \textit{Pikto Tegner} and \textit{Pikto Oplæser} need the sound playing feature. 

\textit{Pikto Tegner} needs it to get a preview of the sound recorded, to be saved when creating a pictogram.

\textit{Pikto Oplæser} needs the feature as the key of \textit{Pikto Oplæser} is to get the sound of the pictograms played sequentially. 

The cooperation for developing the library was done by way of pair programming, with one person from each group.
As of such, a mutual agreement was found for how the library should be developed.

When initializing the library it needs a context and can additionally take a path for the sound file, a pictogram, or a bytearray. The context is needed for the PictoMediaPlayer to know where to play the sound. Below in \lstref{lst:constructor} we see a constructor for the PictoMediaPlayer.

%\begin{code}{lst:constructor}{Constructor for PictoMediaPlayer.}
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:constructor, caption = {Constructor for PictoMediaPlayer}]
    public PictoMediaPlayer (Context activity, String path)
    {
        this.activity = activity;
        assignMediaPlayer();
        setDataSource(path);
    }
\end{lstlisting}
%\end{code}

When assigning a datasource to the PictoMediaPlayer the \textit{setDataSource} method, seen in \lstref{lst:setdatasource}, is called. The method releases an old MediaPlayer and assigns a new one if sound has already been attached to the MediaPlayer.
Then the MediaPlayer gets a file descriptor assigned as source.

%\begin{code}{lst:setdatasource}{SetDataSource method of PictoMediaPlayer.}
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:setdatasource, caption={SetDataSource method of PictoMediaPlayer}]
public void setDataSource(String path){
        if(hasSound)
        {
            mediaPlayer.release();
            assignMediaPlayer();
        }

        try {
            FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(path);

            mediaPlayer.setDataSource(fileInputStream.getFD());
            hasSound = true;
        }
        catch (IOException e)
        {
            e.getStackTrace();
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}
%\end{code}

The OnCompleteListener, seen in \lstref{lst:completelistener}, is necessary for external sources to detect when a sound is finished playing. The CompleteListener allows external sources to respond to a sound finished playing, e.g. a button icon change.

%\begin{code}{lst:completelistener}{onCompleteListener method of PictoMediaPlayer.}
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:completelistener, caption = {onCompleteListener method of PictoMediaPlayer}]
private final MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener onCompletionListener = new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener() {
        @Override
        public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {
            isPlaying = false;
            if(customListener != null){
                customListener.soundDonePlaying();
            }
        }
    };

    public interface CompleteListener{
        public void soundDonePlaying();
    }
\end{lstlisting}
%\end{code}

To illustrate the ease of use of the PictoMediaPlayer we created the example seen in \lstref{lst:mediaplayerexample}. 
We here see how a PictoMediaPlayer is used to play a sound and writing ``Sound is finished playing'' when the sound is finished playing.

%\begin{code}{lst:mediaplayerexample}{Example of PictoMediaPlayer.}
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:mediaplayerexample, caption={Example of PictoMediaPlayer}]
public class example implements PictoMediaPlayer.CompleteListener{
    private void examplemethod(Context context, String path)
    {
        PictoMediaPlayer pictoMediaPlayer = new PictoMediaPlayer(context, path);

        pictoMediaPlayer.playSound();
    }

    @Override
    public void soundDonePlaying() {
        System.out.print("Sound is finished playing");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
%\end{code}

%Disposition
%interest in the feature from both groups

% why?
% easy use
% just specify a filepath and all features are there. 



% List of features:
    % abstracts away of the states of android's MediaPlayer
    % Play and stop music
    % supports customer listerner for listening to when sound is done playing.
