\chapter{Collaboration Chapter 1}
Sound for pictograms was deemed important by the customers, and as of such, \textit{Piktotegner} and \textit{Piktoopl√¶ser} chose to cooperate in developing libraries for this.
The libraries is mainly split into two parts, a media player and a text to speech library.
The cooperation for developing the libraries was done by way of pair programming, with one person from each group per library.
As of such, a mutual agreement was found for how the libraries should be developed.
A description of these as well as motivation and a description of their implementation will be given hereafter.
