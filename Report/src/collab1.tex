\chapter{Collaboration - Audio}
\textit{This chapter was written in collaboration between the groups sw608f14 and sw615f14 and is in both reports.}\\

Sound for pictograms was deemed important by the customers, and as of such, \textit{Piktotegner} and \textit{Piktoopl√¶ser} chose to cooperate in developing libraries for this.
The libraries are mainly split into two parts, a media player and a Text-To-Speech library.
The cooperation for developing the libraries is done by way of pair programming, with one person from each group per library.
As of such, a mutual agreement is found for how the libraries should be developed.
A description of these as well as motivation and a description of their implementation is given hereafter.
