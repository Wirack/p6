\chapter{Sprint 1}
The first sprint of this project was decided to run from 20th of February to the 19th of March.
The primarily focus of this sprint for all groups was to get the existing code to work.
For this project the code chosen was the Croc application developed in spring 2013, which is responsible for creating pictograms.
