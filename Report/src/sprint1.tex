\chapter{First Sprint}
The first sprint of this project is decided to run from 20th of February to the 19th of March.
The primary focus of this sprint for all groups is to get the existing code to work.
For this sprint, we choose \textit{Croc} \citep{misc:crocold} to be the application which we develop on.
\textit{Croc} was developed in the spring of 2013 and is responsible for creating pictograms.
