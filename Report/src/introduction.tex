Disabled people need help and this help can nowadays be given through the use of technology.
However, there are still some disabled people who are using non-technological solutions to aid their needs.
Among these people, are people suffering from the mental disability known as autism.
There are many different forms of autism, ranging from super intelligent to being unable to speak.
A shared trait, though, is the inability to feel empathy.
The result of this is that they cannot interpret emotions, causing them to have difficulties when interacting with other people in social contexts.
The main focus is to help autistic people, primarily the ones who have trouble with speech.
Currently, physical folders with pictograms are being used to communicate with the guardians.
These folders are very cumbersome since they can grow very large in size.
Furthermore, it can be very difficult to find the specific pictogram you are looking for.
This is sought to be improved through technology by creating an application on a mobile device that fulfils the same functionality as the folders.
By creating this application, it is possible to have the pictograms located at one place without having it grow in size.
In addition to this, it could be easier for the people to find the specific pictogram by creating a search function in the application.

Currently this project is an ongoing development, which is built upon the work of previous students.
Therefore, the project will primarily focus on getting the current features to work as intended, with potential for new functionality if there are no further improvements available to the current features.
The development is done in four SCRUM sprints detailing the process of each.
