meeting 1/05-2014
seems better than other group

he can see our efforts

coordinator feedback:
he didnt get any more than us
coordinator meeting after steering meeting


structure matches project guidelines
content seems decent and on track
two chapters on colaboration,  group might be ok, but better get 2

write something about how you use the database.

not so sure the sensor will understand the way colision detection is written
should write about it in principle

be able to explain, simply, how the math in fx colision detection works

resize after rotate still has room for improvement, he has trouble understanding how it works exactly

about resize, write what you tried, even though it didnt work.

make issues understandable and look at their importance and remove insignificant ones.

maybe write what came of communication with the custommers (likely sprint2 related)

make sure the change in colision detection is clear, going from hitting with click inside the hitbox to hit when clicking the object itself.
