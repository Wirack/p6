structure is good

context of the multiproject, what was the reasoning behind the creation of GIRAF.
motivation for creating pictotegner
maybe compare this tool with other excisting tools
why is pictotegner even needed?

what was your role in the multiproject
semester seems to be about project management, so talk about how you did development, in addition to what you did.
place project management after slide 6 (suggestion) or as a part of the media player colaboration slide.

define what a specialist is, since it is unique for GIRAF.

good ideas from the other group:
project management.
pictures of current situation at the institutes
requirements -> redmine issues
useability methodology
conclusion? (might be contained in our future work)

start with the interesting stuff, gets audience attention and keep it
mention program early
overview maybe not needed.
focus on what the goal of the presentation is
title smaller than content
limit information on slides
animations for steps, to keep audience attention


emulator and tablet at the same time might distract the audience.
sensor likely to try to break it.
