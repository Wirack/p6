\section{PictoMediaPlayer}
Associating sound to pictograms was stated as of great importance from the customers.
For that reason a library is developed that provides an easy to use sound playing service.

Both \textit{Pikto Tegner} and \textit{Pikto Oplæser} need the sound playing feature. 

\textit{Pikto Tegner} needs it to get a preview of the sound recorded, to be saved when creating a pictogram.

\textit{Pikto Oplæser} needs the feature as the key of \textit{Pikto Oplæser} is to get the sound of the pictograms played sequentially. 

The cooperation for developing the library was done by way of pair programming, with one person from each group.
As of such, a mutual agreement was found for how the library should be developed.
